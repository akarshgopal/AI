AI refresher and catchup bootcamp Dec 2023.
DL 0 -> SOTA 5 Day

# Plan

## Day 1: Back to Basics
Goal for the day: Refresh all ML and NN basics (learned so far)
- Classic ML refresh (5 hrs)
	- [-] KNNs
	- [-] SVMs
	- [ ] Collaborative filtering and K-means
	- [ ] PCA
	- [-] Decision trees and random forests
- Data handling, data set prep fundamentals (2 hrs)
	- [-] Train / Val  Split -> Test
	- [-] Normalisation, cleaning
- Perf fundamentals (1 hr)
	- [-] Precision, Recall and confusion matrix

## Day 2: Neural Net Zoo
- Basic NN via torch / maybe some mojo or mlx
- Implement, train and tune the major types of NNs (up until):
	- FFN (1 hr)
    - Classify

## Day 3: More Zoo, then Time to Pay Attention
  - Training concepts (2 hrs)
    - Loss functions
    - Regularisation / Normalisation
    - Optimisers
	- CNNs (2 hrs)
	- RNN (3 hrs)
    - RNNs 
		- LSTMs
		- GRUs
  - Autoencoders (2 hrs)

- Implement attention (cross and self), understand what is going on
- Implement GPT-2 from paper using pytorch basic blocks. 

## Day 4: Dream Machine
- Goal: Implement the diffusion model pipeline, and train a toy latent diffusion model


## Day 4: Down the abstraction elevator we go
- Goal: Go top down, and implement as much of the stack ourselves as we call
- Matrix Math
- Chain Rule
- Optimizers
- Regulatisation
- Normalisation
-
