    "#### Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Added a 'Layout of the Assignment' text block outlining the Assignment and motivating its structure\n",
    "2. One hot encoding and inverse functions are now provided. It is recommended that you attempt to recreate these functions in order to understand what they're doing.\n",
    "3. Unit test code block and expected output are provided after each major code block\n",
    "4. The class Layer is clearly defined and motivated\n",
    "5. Class functions now have self passed in all definitions. object creations are done for you in order to avoid issues that could arise out of improper creations.\n",
    "6. Structure of Model class is provided prior to SGD since SGD requires calling of member functions of this class\n",
    "7. Variable names referring to partial derivatives are more explicit and mention which layer they correspond to. For example dZ, A0, etc are now dL_dZ_next respectively.\n",
    "8. Removed all instances of reg_lambda, and beta. So SGD is now without momentum and weight updates are not regularized.\n",
    "9. #INSERT CODE HERE# is now ''' INSERT CODE HERE ''' - highlighted in red for more visibility\n",
    "10. In some cases, example code is provided. This will work once uncommented. It is recommended to understand what this code is doing and what it means conceptually.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you recall logistic regression, we model a classification problem as a non-linear function of the input vector.\n",
    "When the problem in question is quite complicated, and the number of possible input features are large, simple classification, regression or classic ML techniques have limited ability. Composing functions of functions, say $f( g( h(X,W_{0}),W_{1}),W_{2}) $ would be better equipped to 'learn' more complicated functions. \n",

    "NNs are effectively compositions of functions consisting of layers of 'nodes'. The permuted connections between these nodes allow complex 'functions' to be 'learnt'. Depicted below is a 3-layer NN, consisting of an input layer, a 'hidden' layer and an output layer.\n",
